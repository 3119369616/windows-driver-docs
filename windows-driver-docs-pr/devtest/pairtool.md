# PairTool

PairTool (PairTool.exe) is a command line tool that lets authenticated users and administrators work with devices based on protocols. Some examples include:  

- Enumerate protocol-based devices and their services and device containers.
- Pair and unpair devices.
- Perform a device presence challenge as device lifetime is lossy on many protocols.

## Where can I download PairTool?

PairTool is included in the %windir%\system32 directory with every version of Windows 11 version XXXX and later. There isn't a separate PairTool download package.

- Open a Command Prompt window.
- Type `pairtool /?` to view command options. For more information, see [PairTool command syntax](pairtool-command-syntax.md).
