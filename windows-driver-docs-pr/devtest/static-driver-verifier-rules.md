# DDI Compliance Rules

This section lists and describes the Windows Device Driver Interface (DDI) Compliance Rules that you can use to verify Windows Driver Model (WDM), Kernel Mode Driver Framework (KMDF), Audio (PortCls), AVStream (KS), NDIS, and Storport drivers. The DDI Compliance rules define requirements for the proper interaction between a driver and the kernel interface of the operating system.

[Rules for Audio Drivers](rules-for-audio-drivers.md)  
[Rules for AVStream Drivers](rules-for-avstream-drivers.md)  
[Rules for WDM Drivers](sdv-rules-for-wdm-drivers.md)  
[Rules for KMDF Drivers](sdv-rules-for-kmdf-drivers.md)  
[Rules for NDIS Drivers](sdv-rules-for-ndis-drivers.md)  
[Rules for Storport Drivers](sdv-rules-for-storport-drivers.md)  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows Hardware Compatibility Program requires CodeQL for Static Tool Logo (STL) Tests on our Client and Server Operating Systems. We will continue to maintain support for SDV and CA on older products.  Partners are highly encouraged to review the CodeQL requirements for the [Static Tool Logo Test](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/testref/6ab6df93-423c-4af6-ad48-8ea1049155ae).
> For more information about using CodeQL, see [CodeQL and the Static Tools Logo Test](static-tools-and-codeql.md).

## Driver Verification Tools

You can use the code analysis tools, [Static Driver Verifier](./static-driver-verifier.md) and [Driver Verifier](./driver-verifier.md) to test a driver for compliance to the DDI usage rules. Static Driver Verifier (SDV) performs static analysis on the driver source code, so you can use SDV early in development cycle. Driver Verifier is integrated with the operating system, so you can test a driver at runtime after it has been built, deployed, and installed.

Using the driver source code, [Static Driver Verifier](./static-driver-verifier.md) creates a model of the driver and the operating system. In this model, SDV places the driver in a hostile environment and systematically tests code paths through the driver by looking for violations of a formalized set of the driver compliance rules ([Static Driver Verifier rules](./static-driver-verifier-rule.md)).

Starting in WindowsÂ 8, you can configure [Driver Verifier](./driver-verifier.md) to run some of the same compliance checks on installed drivers by enabling [DDI compliance checking](./ddi-compliance-checking.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SDV is no longer supported and SDV is not available in Windows 24H2 WDK or EWDK releases. It is not available in WDKs newer than build 26017, and is not included in the Windows 24H2 RTM WDK.
> SDV can still be used by downloading the Windows 11, version 22H2 EWDK (released October 24, 2023) with Visual Studio build tools 17.1.5 from [Download the Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](../download-the-wdk.md). Only the use of the Enterprise WDK to run SDV is recommended. Using older versions of the standard WDK in conjunction with recent releases of Visual Studio is not recommended, as this will likely result in analysis failures. <br>
> Going forward, CodeQL will be the primary static analysis tool for drivers. CodeQL provides a powerful query language that treats code as a database to be queried, making it simple to write queries for specific behaviors, patterns, and more.
> For more information about using CodeQL, see [CodeQL and the Static Tools Logo Test](static-tools-and-codeql.md).
