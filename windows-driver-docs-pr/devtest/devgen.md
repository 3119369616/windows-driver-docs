# DevGen

DevGen (DevGen.exe) is a command line tool that lets an administrator create software and root-enumerated devices for testing purposes.

## Where can I download DevGen?

- Open a **Command Prompt** window (**Run as administrator**).
- Navigate to the WDK tools folder for the desired architecture.
- Type `devgen /?` to view command options. See [**DevGen Command Syntax**](devgen-command-syntax.md) for more information.
