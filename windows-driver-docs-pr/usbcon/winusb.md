# Introduction to WinUSB for Developers  
   
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer experiencing USB problems, see [Fix USB-C problems in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/fix-usb-c-problems-in-windows-f4e0e529-74f5-cdae-3194-43743f30eed2).  
   
## Why WinUSB Matters for Driver Developers  
   
As a driver developer, understanding WinUSB (Windows USB) can significantly streamline your development process, especially when working with USB devices. WinUSB is a generic driver included with Windows that allows you to communicate with USB devices without the need to write a custom driver. This can save you time, reduce complexity, and ensure compatibility across different Windows versions.  
   
### Key Benefits of Using WinUSB  
   
1. **Simplified Development**:  
   - **Ease of Use**: WinUSB abstracts much of the complexity involved in USB communication, making it easier for you to interact with USB devices.  
   - **No Custom Driver Needed**: For many USB devices, WinUSB can be used directly, eliminating the need to write and maintain a custom driver.  
   
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:  
   - **Standardized Interface**: WinUSB provides a standardized interface for USB communication, which can be beneficial for ensuring compatibility across different Windows versions.  
   
3. **Time and Cost Efficiency**:  
   - **Reduced Development Time**: Using WinUSB can significantly reduce the time required to develop and test a USB driver.  
   - **Lower Maintenance Costs**: Since WinUSB is maintained by Microsoft, you can rely on it being updated and supported, reducing long-term maintenance costs.  
   
4. **Access to USB Features**:  
   - **Full USB Functionality**: WinUSB supports a wide range of USB features, including bulk transfers, control transfers, interrupt transfers, and isochronous transfers.  
   
### What You Can Accomplish with WinUSB  
   
1. **Device Communication**:  
   - **Data Transfer**: Send and receive data to and from a USB device using bulk, control, interrupt, or isochronous transfers.  
   - **Control Requests**: Send control requests to configure the device or retrieve information.  
   
2. **Device Configuration**:  
   - **Setting Configuration**: Configure the USB device by selecting configurations, interfaces, and alternate settings.  
   - **Endpoint Management**: Manage endpoints for data transfer.  
   
3. **Device Enumeration**:  
   - **Device Identification**: Enumerate and identify USB devices connected to the system.  
   - **Descriptor Retrieval**: Retrieve device descriptors, configuration descriptors, interface descriptors, and endpoint descriptors.  
   
4. **Custom Applications**:  
   - **User-Mode Applications**: Develop user-mode applications that communicate with USB devices using the WinUSB API.  
   - **Firmware Updates**: Implement firmware update mechanisms for USB devices.  
   
5. **Testing and Debugging**:  
   - **Prototyping**: Quickly prototype USB device communication to test hardware functionality.  
   - **Debugging**: Use WinUSB to debug communication issues between the host and the USB device.  
   
### Components of WinUSB  
   
WinUSB includes:  
- A kernel-mode driver (Winusb.sys)  
- A user-mode dynamic link library (Winusb.dll) that exposes WinUSB functions described in [winusb.h](/windows/win32/api/winusb#functions). You can use these functions to manage USB devices with user-mode software.  
   
By default, Winusb.sys is installed in the device's kernel-mode stack as an upper filter driver. Apps communicate with the device's UMDF function driver to issue read, write, or device I/O control requests. In this configuration, Winusb.sys serves as the device stack's Plug and Play and power owner. You can also install Winusb.sys as the function driver for a USB device.  
   
### Getting Started with WinUSB  
   
This section includes information on:  
- Selecting the correct driver for a device  
- Using WinUSB to communicate with USB devices  
- Installing Winusb.sys as the function driver for a USB device  
   
You will also find detailed code examples that show how apps and USB devices communicate.  
   
> [!NOTE]  
> Windows 7 supports WinUSB on x86-based, x64-based, and Itanium-based systems. More recent versions of Windows support WinUSB on x86-based and x64-based systems.  
>  
> WinUSB supports isochronous transfers starting in Windows 8.
