# Bluetooth radio reset and recovery

Bluetooth radio reset and recovery are a technology in Windows 10, version 1803 and later that introduces a robust reset and recovery mechanism for Bluetooth radios. This mechanism enables Bluetooth radios to recover from hardware failures that lead to malfunction, loss of connectivity, or unresponsiveness to operational commands. The goal is to automatically recover the radio, making the user experience seamless and reducing the likelihood of requiring a system restart.

Bluetooth radio reset and recovery can be implemented with or without firmware dependencies. Hardware partners can extend the software-based reset mechanisms available on all Windows PCs with supported device- or firmware-level reset mechanisms to increase the likelihood of successful recovery.

## Bluetooth reset and recovery scenarios

There are three broad categories of issues where reset and recovery are initiated:

- **Bus enumeration failures:** The radio fails enumeration or re-enumeration by the underlying bus (typically USB or UART) as indicated by a *visible failed state* (yellow bang) in Device Manager, which might be symptomatic of underlying hardware errors.

- **Driver enumeration failures:** The Bluetooth radio is in a failed state *after* successful enumeration by the underlying bus. This failed state typically occurs when building up the driver stack for the radio. For example, when a filter or function driver is installed on the Bluetooth radio device node. Failures could occur if a driver encounters an error during one or more start operations and as a result reports a PnP failure. An example of such an operation could be a firmware download to the device.

- **Non-enumeration failures:** The device isn't in a failed state but is otherwise not operational as determined by the driver stack. These failures are outside of the enumeration pathway and could be general critical transport-specific failures or device-specific failures such as a catastrophic firmware error. The following Bluetooth reset and recovery mechanisms are used in these cases.

## Reset and recovery mechanisms

While there are different approaches to recover from a failed state, Bluetooth uses a standardized ACPI-based recovery mechanism to attempt to restore the radio to a working state.

[GUID_DEVICE_RESET_INTERFACE_STANDARD](../kernel/working-with-guid-device-reset-interface-standard.md) defines two levels of reset. The reset mechanisms work only for **internal devices** so externally pluggable Bluetooth radios such as dongles aren't supported. The reset mechanisms require support both in Windows (typically by the function driver stack) and the underlying firmware (typically in the ACPI BIOS) to actually perform the reset. The actual reset mechanism is system-specific.

| Reset Level | Implementation |
|--|--|
| Function-level device reset (FLDR) | The reset operation is restricted to a specific device and isn't visible to other devices. There's no re-enumeration. Function drivers must assume that the hardware returned to its original state after the operation. Intermediary state isn't preserved. |
| Platform-level device reset (PLDR) | The reset operation affects a specific device and all other devices that are connected to it via the same power rail or reset line. The reset operation causes the device to be reported as missing from the bus and re-enumerated. This type of reset has the most impact on the system since all devices that share the resource go back to their original state. |

- **To support FLDR** there must be an __RST method defined inside the device scope as detailed in [ACPI firmware: Function-level reset](../kernel/working-with-guid-device-reset-interface-standard.md#acpi-firmware-function-level-reset).

- **To support PLDR** there must be an __RST or__PR3 method defined under the device scope as detailed in [ACPI firmware: Platform-level reset](../kernel/working-with-guid-device-reset-interface-standard.md#acpi-firmware-platform-level-reset). If a __PR3_ method is used, ACPI uses the D3Cold power cycle mechanism to reset. The D3Cold power cycle mechanism emulates removing power from the device and then restoring it. If any other devices share the same power rail, they also reset. If an__RST_ method is defined and referenced by a __PRR_ (PowerResource), then all devices that use that PowerResource are affected.

  - Since PLDR works only for internal devices, it must be declared as such in ACPI. For USB devices, to specify a port that is internal (not user visible) and can be connected to an integrated device, set the __UPC.PortIsConnectable_ byte to 0xFF and the__PLD.UserVisible_ bit to 0.

  - If the __PR3_ (D3Cold) mechanism is used for PLDR, ensure that scenarios like SystemWake and DeviceWake continue to work. Nominally, this means that there are appropriate power resources defined for D2, e.g.__PR2_. The following table is a useful guide:

| Power state | ACPI resource | Behavior |
|--|--|--|
| D2 | _PR2 | Any power or clocks required for the class-defined reduced-functionality of this state. |
| D3 Hot (required) | _PR2 | The same resources as the next higher state that is supported (D2, D1, or D0). |
| D3Cold | _PR3 | Only the power or clocks required for the device to appear on its bus and respond to a bus-specific command. |
