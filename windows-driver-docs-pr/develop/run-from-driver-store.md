# Run From Driver Store

An INF that is using 'run from [Driver Store](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-store)' means that the INF uses [**DIRID 13**](../install/using-dirids.md) to specify the location for driver package files on install.

For a 'run from Driver Store' file payloaded by an INF, the *subdir* listed in the [**SourceDisksFiles**](../install/inf-sourcedisksfiles-section.md) entry for the file in the INF **must** match the subdir listed in the [**DestinationDirs**](../install/inf-destinationdirs-section.md) entry for the file in the INF.

Additionally, a [**CopyFiles**](../install/inf-copyfiles-directive.md) directive cannot be used to rename a file that is run from Driver Store. These restrictions are required so that the installation of an INF on a device does not result in the creation of new files in the Driver Store directory.

Since [**SourceDisksFiles**](../install/inf-sourcedisksfiles-section.md) entries cannot have multiple entries with the same filename and CopyFiles cannot be used to rename a file, every 'run from Driver Store' file that an INF references must have a unique file name.

## Dynamically finding and loading files from the Driver Store

Sometimes there is a need for a component to load a file that is part of a driver package that uses 'run from Driver Store'.  Paths to these driver package files should not be hardcoded as they can be different between different versions of the driver package, different OS versions, different OS editions, etc.  When such a need to load driver package files arises, these driver package files should be discovered and loaded dynamically using some of the paradigms described below.

### Find and load files in the same driver package

When a file in a driver package needs to load another file from the same driver package, one potential option for dynamically discovering that file is to determine the directory that this file is running from and to load the other file relative to that directory.

A WDM or KMDF driver that is running from the Driver Store on Windows 10 version 1803 and later which needs to access other files from its driver package should call [**IoGetDriverDirectory**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iogetdriverdirectory) with *DriverDirectoryImage* as the directory type to get the directory path that the driver was loaded from. Alternatively for drivers that need to support OS versions before Windows 10 version 1803, use [**IoQueryFullDriverPath**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-ioqueryfulldriverpath) to find the driver's path, get the directory path it was loaded from, and look for files relative to that path.  If the kernel mode driver is a KMDF driver, it can use [**WdfDriverWdmGetDriverObject**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/nf-wdfdriver-wdfdriverwdmgetdriverobject) to retrieve the WDM driver object to pass to IoQueryFullDriverPath. 

Usermode binaries can use [**GetModuleHandleExW**](/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getmodulehandleexw) and [**GetModuleFileNameW**](/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getmodulefilenamew) to determine where the driver was loaded from.  For example, a UMDF driver binary may do something like the following:

```cpp
bRet = GetModuleHandleExW(GET_MODULE_HANDLE_EX_FLAG_FROM_ADDRESS,
                         (PCWSTR)&DriverEntry,
                         &handleModule);
if (bRet) {
    charsWritten = GetModuleFileNameW(handleModule,
                                      path,
                                      pathLength);
    â€¦
```

### Find and load files in any driver package

In some scenarios, a driver package may contain a file that is intended to be loaded by a binary in another driver package or by a user mode component.  This method can also be used for files from the same driver package if this is preferred over the method described above for loading files from the same driver package.

Here are a couple of examples of scenarios that may involve loading files from a driver package:

* A user mode DLL in a driver package provides an interface for communicating with a driver in the driver package.
* An [extension driver package](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/using-an-extension-inf-file) contains a configuration file that is loaded by the driver in the base driver package.

In these situations, the driver package should set some state on a device or device interface that indicates the path of the file that is expected to be loaded.

A driver package would typically use an HKR [**AddReg**](../install/inf-addreg-directive.md) to set this state. For this example, it should be assumed that for `ExampleFile.dll`, the driver package has a [**SourceDisksFiles**](../install/inf-sourcedisksfiles-section.md) entry with no *subdir*.  This results in the file being at the root of the driver package directory. It should also be assumed that the [**DestinationDirs**](../install/inf-destinationdirs-section.md) for a [**CopyFiles**](../install/inf-copyfiles-directive.md) directive specifies **dirid** 13.

Here is an INF example for setting this as device state:

```cpp
[ExampleDDInstall.HW]
AddReg = Example_DDInstall.AddReg

[Example_DDInstall.AddReg]
HKR,,ExampleValue,,%13%\ExampleFile.dll
```

An INF example for setting this as device interface state would be:

```cpp
[ExampleDDInstall.Interfaces]
AddInterface = {<fill in an interface class GUID for an interface exposed by the device>},,Example_Add_Interface_Section

[Example_Add_Interface_Section]
AddReg = Example_Add_Interface_Section.AddReg

[Example_Add_Interface_Section.AddReg]
HKR,,ExampleValue,,%13%\ExampleFile.dll
```

The previous examples use an empty flags value, which results in a REG_SZ registry value. This results in the **%13%** being turned into a fully qualified user mode file path. In many cases, it is preferable to have the path be relative to an environment variable. If a flags value of **0x20000** is used, the registry value is of type REG_EXPAND_SZ and the **%13%** converts to a path with appropriate environment variables to abstract the location of the path. When retrieving this registry value, call [**ExpandEnvironmentStrings**](/windows/win32/api/rrascfg/nn-rrascfg-ieapproviderconfig) to resolve the environment variables in the path.

If the value needs to be read by a kernel mode component, the value should be a REG_SZ value. When the kernel mode component reads that value, it should prepend `\??\` before passing it to APIs such as [**ZwOpenFile**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-zwopenfile).

To access this setting when it is part of the device's state, first the application must find the identity of the device.  User mode code can use [**CM_Get_Device_ID_List_Size**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_get_device_id_list_sizea) and [**CM_Get_Device_ID_List**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_get_device_id_lista) to get a list of devices, filtered as necessary. That list of devices might contain multiple devices, so search for the appropriate device before reading state from the device. For example, call [**CM_Get_DevNode_Property**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_get_devnode_propertyw) to retrieve properties on the device when looking for a device matching specific criteria.

Once the correct device is found, call [**CM_Open_DevNode_Key**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_open_devnode_key) to get a handle to the registry location where the device state was stored.

Kernel mode code should retrieve a PDO (physical device object) to the device with the state and call [**IoOpenDeviceRegistryKey**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioopendeviceregistrykey).  One possible way for the kernel mode code to retrieve the PDO of the device would be to discover an enabled interface exposed by the device and use [**IoGetDeviceObjectPointer**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iogetdeviceobjectpointer) to retrieve the device object.

To access this setting when it is device interface state, User mode code can call [**CM_Get_Device_Interface_List_Size**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_get_device_interface_list_sizea) and [**CM_Get_Device_Interface_List**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_get_device_interface_lista).

Additionally [**CM_Register_Notification**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_register_notification) can be used to be notified of arrivals and removals of device interfaces so the code gets notified when the interface is enabled and then can retrieve the state. There may be multiple device interfaces in the device interface class used in the above APIs.  Examine those interfaces to determine which is the correct interface for the setting to read.

Once the correct device interface is found, call [**CM_Open_Device_Interface_Key**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_open_device_interface_keyw).

Kernel mode code can retrieve a symbolic link name for the device interface from which to get state. To do so, call [**IoRegisterPlugPlayNotification**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioregisterplugplaynotification) to register for device interface notifications on the appropriate device interface class.  Alternatively, call [**IoGetDeviceInterfaces**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iogetdeviceinterfaces) to get a list of current device interfaces on the system.  There may be multiple device interfaces in the device interface class used in the above APIs.  Examine those interfaces to determine which is the correct interface that should have the setting to be read.

Once the appropriate symbolic link name is found, call [**IoOpenDeviceInterfaceRegistryKey**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioopendeviceinterfaceregistrykey) to retrieve a handle to the registry location where the device interface state was stored.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the **CM_GETIDLIST_FILTER_PRESENT** flag with [CM_Get_Device_ID_List_Size](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_get_device_id_list_sizea) and [**CM_Get_Device_ID_List**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_get_device_id_lista) or the **CM_GET_DEVICE_INTERFACE_LIST_PRESENT** flag with [**CM_Get_Device_Interface_List_Size**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_get_device_interface_list_sizew) and [**CM_Get_Device_Interface_List**](/windows/win32/api/cfgmgr32/nf-cfgmgr32-cm_get_device_interface_lista). This ensures that the hardware related to the state that contains the file path is present and ready for communication.

## Removing driver package

By default, a driver package cannot be removed from the system if it is still installed on any devices.  However, some options for removing a driver package from the system allow for it to be attempted to be 'force' removed.  This attempts to remove the driver package even if that driver package is still installed on some devices on the system.  Force removals are not allowed for driver packages that have any files that are 'run from Driver Store'.  When a driver package is removed from the system, its Driver Store contents are removed.  If there are any devices that are still installed with that driver package, any 'run from Driver Store' files in that driver package will now be gone and those missing files may cause that device to malfunction.  To prevent putting the device into a bad state like that, driver packages that contain any 'run from Driver Store' files cannot be force removed.  They can only be removed once they are no longer installed on any devices.  To aid in removals of such driver packages, [**DiUninstallDriver**](/windows/win32/api/newdev/nf-newdev-diuninstalldriverw) or [pnputil /delete-driver <oem#.inf> /uninstall](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/pnputil-command-syntax) can be used.  These methods of removal will first update any devices using the driver package being removed to no longer be installed with that driver package before attempting to remove the driver package.

## Driver package development

### Testing private binaries

When developing a driver package, if there is a need to replace a particular executable file from the driver package with a private version instead of fully rebuilding and replacing the driver package on the system, then it is recommended that a kernel debugger is used along with the [**.kdfiles**](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-kdfiles--set-driver-replacement-map-) command.  Since the full path to the file in the Driver Store should not be hardcoded, it is recommended that in the .kdfiles mapping, the *OldDriver* file name is just the direct name of the file with no preceding path information.  To facilitate this (and other scenarios), names of files in driver packages should be as unique as possible so it does not match the name of a file from an unrelated driver package on the system.
