# .restart (Restart Kernel Connection)


The **.restart** command restarts the kernel connection.

Do not confuse this command with the [**.restart (Restart Target Application)**](-restart--restart-target-application-.md) command, which works only in user mode.

```dbgcmd
.restart 
```

### Environment

You can use the **.restart** command only in KD.

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p><strong>Modes</strong></p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Kernel mode only</p></td>

### Additional Information

For more information about reestablishing contact with the target, see [Synchronizing with the Target Computer](../debugger/synchronizing-with-the-target-computer.md).

## Remarks

The **.restart** command is similar to the [**CTRL+R (Re-synchronize)**](../debugger/ctrl-r--re-synchronize-.md) command, except that **.restart** is even more extensive in its effect. This command is equivalent to ending the debugger and then attaching a new debugger to the target computer.

The **.restart** command is most useful when you are performing [remote debugging through remote.exe](../debugger/remote-debugging-through-remote-exe.md) and ending and restarting the debugger might be difficult. However, you cannot use **.restart** from a debugging client if you are performing remote debugging through the debugger.
