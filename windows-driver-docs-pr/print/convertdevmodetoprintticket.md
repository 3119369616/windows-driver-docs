# ConvertDevModeToPrintTicket overview

Unidrv and PScript5 print drivers create the Print Ticket by using the elements from the public and private parts of the [**DEVMODEW**](/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodew) structure that the drivers support. The [**IPrintTicketProvider::ConvertDevModeToPrintTicket**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/prdrvcom/nf-prdrvcom-iprintticketprovider-convertdevmodetoprintticket) method is called for each print driver plug-in that was installed.

The following illustration shows the order of the calls to **IPrintOemPrintTicketProvider::ConvertDevModeToPrintTicket** when the driver call **ConvertDevModeToPrintTicket**.
