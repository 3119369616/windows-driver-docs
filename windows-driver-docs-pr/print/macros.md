# Macros (GPD language)

The GPD language supports two types of macros:

- [Block macros](block-macros.md), which allow you to specify a set of GPD file entries that can be inserted in its entirety anywhere in a GPD file.

- [Value macros](value-macros.md), which allow you to specify sets of values that can be inserted individually anywhere in a GPD file.
