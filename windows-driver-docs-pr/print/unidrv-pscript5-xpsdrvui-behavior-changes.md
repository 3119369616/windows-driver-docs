# Unidrv/PScript5 XPSDrv UI behavior changes

[!include[Print Support Apps](../includes/print-support-apps.md)]

A Unidrv/PScript5 driver that is running in XPSDrv mode creates the following core driver default UI behavior changes. (In the following table, "PS only" means the behavior change is specific to a PScript5 driver. "Unidrv only" means the behavior change is specific to Unidrv driver. If both of these phrases don't appear, the behavior change applies to both Unidrv and PScript5 drivers.)

| UI | Non-XPSDrv behavior | XPSDrv behavior |
|--|--|--|
| Orientation<br>(**Layout** tab) | (PS only) The hard-coded UI has three options: Portrait, Landscape, and Rotated Landscape. | (PS only) The hard-coded Orientation UI isn't displayed. |
| Copy Count<br>(**Advanced** tab) | (Unidrv only) The Copy Count UI is always displayed unless the GPD file has a "Collate" feature with "ConcealFromUI?: TRUE"<br><br>(Unidrv only) When EMF is enabled, the Copy Count UI is hard-coded to have an upper limit that is the maximum value of 9999 or the GPD file's specified \*MaxCopies value.<br><br>(Unidrv only) When EMF is disabled, Copy Count has an upper limit of the GPD file*MaxCopies value.<br><br>(PS only) The Copy Count UI is always displayed, with an upper limit that is hard-coded to be 9999. | (Unidrv only) The Copy Count UI behaves the same as the non-XPSDrv behavior with EMF disabled.<br><br>(PS only) Copy Count is always displayed, with an upper limit that is specified in the PPD file's MSXPSMaxCopies value. The upper limit is set to 1 if the PPD file doesn't specify MSXPSMaxCopies. |
| Collated<br>(**Advanced** tab) | When EMF is enabled, the Collated UI (which is a check box next to Copy Count) is hardcoded to display.<br><br>When EMF is disabled, Collated is displayed only if the GPD or PPD file specifies "Collate" as a supported feature, and the "Collate" GPD or PPD feature isn't constrained by any device setting features. | The Collated UI behaves the same as the non-XPSDrv behavior with EMF disabled. |
| Color<br>(**Paper/Quality** tab) | (Unidrv only) The color versus black and white UI selection is shown if the GPD ColorMode feature has one color option. | (Unidrv only) The color versus black and white UI selection is shown if the GPD ColorMode feature has one color option and if the ColorMode feature doesn't specify "ConcealFromUI?: TRUE". |
| ICM Method, ICM Intent<br>(**Advanced** tab) | The ICM Method UI has three hardcoded options for Unidrv: disabled, by host, or by driver. This UI has one more hard-coded option for PScript5 drivers by device.<br><br>The ICM Intent UI has four hard-coded options: Graphics, Picture, Proof, or Match. | The hard-coded ICM Method and ICM Intent UI aren't displayed. |
| Scaling<br>(**Advanced** tab) | Unidrv doesn't show the Scaling UI.<br><br>PScript5 driver shows the Scaling UI with a hard-coded range (1%-1000%). | The hard-coded Scaling UI isn't displayed. You can define a generic GPD or PPD scaling feature (which is shown in the Advanced tree view UI) or provide a custom scaling UI. |
| TrueType Font<br>(**Advanced** tab) | The hard-coded TrueType Font UI has two options: Substitute with Device Font or Download as Softfont. | The hard-coded TrueType Font UI isn't displayed. |
| Pages Per Sheet<br>(**Layout** tab) | For Unidrv, when EMF is enabled, the Pages Per Sheet UI shows seven hard-coded options: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 16, and Booklet.<br><br>For PScript5, the UI shows seven hard-coded options: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 16, and Booklet. | The hard-coded Pages Per Sheet UI isn't displayed. |
| Other EMF Simulation Features<br>(various tabs) | Other EMF simulation features show up in the following locations:<br><br>In the Layout tab, Winprint-based NUp Border UI check box<br>Winprint-based Page Order UI with two hardcoded options: Front to Back and Back to Front. In the Advanced tab:<br><br>Hardcoded "Advanced Printing Features" with two options: Enabled or Disabled.<br>Winprint-based NUp Direction UI with four options: Right-then-Down, Down-then-Right, Left-then-Down, Down-then-Left.<br>Winprint-based Booklet Edge UI. | None of the hard-coded or winprint-based EMF simulation features are displayed. |
| Rendering Features by Unidrv<br>(various tabs) | (Unidrv only) Rendering features are hard-coded in two locations: Quality Macro UI (on Paper/Quality tab) and Print Text as Graphics (on Advanced tab). | (Unidrv only) None of the hard-coded Unidrv rendering features are displayed. |
| Rendering Features by PScript5<br>(**Advanced** tab) | (PS only) Hard-coded "PostScript Options" include: PostScript Output Option, TrueType Font Download Option, PostScript Language Level, Send PostScript Error Handler, Mirrored Output, and Negative Output. | (PS only) None of the hard-coded PS rendering features are displayed. |
| Form-Tray Assignment Table<br>(**DeviceSettings** tab) | The Form-Tray Assignment Table is always displayed to enable administrators to select the form-to-tray assignment. | The core Unidrv or PScript5 driver doesn't display the form-tray assignment table UI. You can provide a custom UI. |
| Font Substitution Table<br>(**DeviceSettings** tab) | The Font Substitution Table is always displayed to enable administrators to select the TrueType font-to-Device font substitution. | The core Unidrv or PScript5 driver doesn't display the font substitution table UI. Vendor plug-ins can provide their own custom UI. |
| Device Features by Unidrv<br>(**DeviceSettings** tab) |(Unidrv only) The hard-coded feature UI includes Font Cartridge or External font installer. | (Unidrv only) None of the hard-coded Unidrv device features are displayed. |
| Device Features by PScript5<br>(**DeviceSettings** tab) | (PS only) The hard-coded feature UI includes: Available PostScript Memory, Output Protocol, Send CTRL-D Before/After, Convert Gray Text, Convert Gray Graphics, Add Euro Currency, Job Timeout, Wait Timeout, Minimum Font Size to Download as Outline, and Maximum Font Size to Download as Bitmap. | (PS only) None of the hard-coded PS device features are displayed. |
