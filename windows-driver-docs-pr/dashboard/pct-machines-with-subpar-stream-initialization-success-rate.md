# Percent of Machines with Subpar Stream Initialization Success Rate

## Description

See the "Audio stream initialization" section at [Audio measures](audio-measures.md)

These measures determine an *audio stream initialization success rate* for each machine and calculates a percentage of machines with less than 90% stream initialization rate. When an application is unable to initialize an audio stream, the user will not have access to the applicationâ€™s audio experience.

Some machines have multiple audio drivers on them. Some audio drivers work together to power the same audio hardware; some audio drivers work separately to power different audio hardware on the same machine.

Measure 11458866 looks at the audio stream initialization success rate for *all* audio hardware on the machine where the driver flight landed.

## Measure attributes

|Attribute|Value|
|----|----|
|**Audience**|Standard|
|**Time period**|Daily, averaged over 7 days|
|**Measurement criteria**|Aggregation of machines|
|**Minimum population**|Dynamic, uses confidence intervals|
|**Passing criteria**|<=1 % of machines an Initialization Success Rate below 90% |
|**Measure IDs**|11458866 - all audio hardware on the flighted machines|

## Calculation

1. The measure aggregates telemetry from a 7-day sliding window into a **percentage of machines that have a subpar initialization rate**.
1. *For each machine, calculate the:*

   a. *Machine's initialization success rate = count (Failed Initializations) / count (total attempted initializations)*

   b. *Failing machine = machine's initialization success rate < 90%*

1. *Machines with subpar initialization = count (failing machines)*
1. *Total machines = count (all machines that attempted initialization)*

### Final calculation

*Percent of machines with subpar initialization rates = Machines with subpar initialization / Total machines*
