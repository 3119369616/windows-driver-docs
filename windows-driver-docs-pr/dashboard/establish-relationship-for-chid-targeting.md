# Establish a relationship for HWID and CHID targeting

Establishing a relationship for computer hardware ID (CHID) or hardware ID (HWID) targeting is a prerequisite for all CHID or HWID targeted driver submissions. Submissions for which a known relationship cannot be validated between the publisher and the owner of the targeted HWIDs or CHIDs will be rejected.

## Steps to establish a relationship

1. Compile a list of the targeted HWIDs and CHIDs and owning companies that you would like to target.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your submission has already been rejected, review the rejection notice on your shipping label page for the HWIDs and CHIDs that need attention. The company (OWNER) for each of the HWIDs or CHIDs will also be listed here.

1. Be prepared with your requesting company seller ID, as well as the company name associated with this seller ID.

1. Provide the owner of the HWID or CHID with this information and request that they send an email in the following format, listing the HWIDs and CHIDs the requesting company is approved to target, to HWID-CHID_Validation@microsoft.com:

    Dear Microsoft,
    Please allow *Requesting Company Name* permission to target our *Owner Company Name* HWIDs listed below:

    - Owner company name and seller ID:
    - Seller ID of the company requesting the relationship (requesting company):
    - CHIDs approved for targeting by the requesting company:
    - HWIDs approved for targeting by the requesting company:

1. Once approval email from the owner company is received and processed by Microsoft you will be able to create a new submission targeting these HWIDs and CHIDs.

## Processing timeline

Typical turnaround time is 24-48 Microsoft Redmond (PST) business hours, once the approval email is received by Microsoft. Email confirmation will be sent from Microsoft to the owning company once complete.
