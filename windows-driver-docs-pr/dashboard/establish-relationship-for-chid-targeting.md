# Establish a relationship for HWID and CHID targeting

Establishing a relationship for CHID or HWID targeting is a prerequisite for all CHID or HWID targeted driver submissions. Submissions for which a known relationship cannot be validated between the publisher and the targeted HWIDs or CHIDs will be rejected.

**To establish a relationship:**

1.	Compile a list of the targeted HWIDâ€™s and CHID's and owning companies that you would like to target.

    Note: If your submission has already been rejected, review the Rejection Notice on your Shipping Label page for the HWID's and/or CHID's that need attention. The Company ("OWNER") for each of the HWID's or CHID's will also be listed here.

2.	Be prepared with YOUR Requesting Company's SellerID, as well as the Company name associated with this SellerID.

3.	 Provide the "OWNER" of the HWID and/or CHID with this information and request that they send an email in the following format to HWID-CHID_Validation@Microsoft.com:

    *Dear Microsoft,                                                          Please allow <SellerID from Step 1> of <Company Name from Step 1> permission to target our <OWNER Company Name> HWID's listed below.ID  TYPE | APPROVED HWID or CHID | OWNING COMPANY SELLER ID | APPROVED COMPANY SELLER ID 

4. Once the approval email from "OWNER" is received and processed by Microsoft you will be able to create a new shipping label targeting these HWID's and CHID's.


**Processing Timeline:**

Requests are processed daily by Microsoft, during normal Microsoft Redmond (PST) business hours. Email confirmation will be sent via email once completed to the owning company that requested the relationship.

Typical Turnaround is 24-48 business hours.
