# Establish a relationship for HWID and CHID targeting

Establishing a relationship for CHID or HWID targeting is a prerequisite for all CHID or HWID targeted driver submissions. Submissions for which a known relationship cannot be validated between the publisher and the targeted HWIDs or CHIDs will be rejected.

**To establish a relationship:**

1.	Compile a list of the targeted HWIDs and CHIDs and owning companies that you would like to target.

    Note: If your submission has already been rejected, review the Rejection Notice on your Shipping Label page for the HWIDs and/or CHIDs that need attention. The Company ("OWNER") for each of the HWIDs or CHIDs will also be listed here.

2.	Be prepared with your REQUESTING Company's SellerID, as well as the Company name associated with this SellerID.

3.	Provide the "OWNER" of the HWID and/or CHID with this information and request that they send an email listing the following to HWID-CHID_Validation@Microsoft.com:

    - OWNER Company Name and Seller ID:
    - Seller ID of Company Requesting Relationship (Requesting Company):
    - CHIDs approved for targeting by Requesting Company:
    - HWIDs approved for targeting by Requesting Company:


4. Once the approval email from "OWNER" is received and processed by Microsoft you will be able to create a new submission targeting these HWIDs and CHIDs.


**Processing timeline:**

Requests are processed daily by Microsoft, during normal Microsoft Redmond (PST) business hours. Email confirmation will be sent via email once completed to the owning company that requested the relationship.

Typical Turnaround is 24-48 business hours.
