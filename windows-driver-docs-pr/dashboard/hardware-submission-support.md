# Get support for Partner Center dashboard issues

There are three steps that you can take to get your issue resolved. This article takes you through the process of each step.

## Step 1: Search the documentation

1. Go to [Partner Center for Windows Hardware documentation](index.yml) to see if your issue is addressed in the documentation.

1. If your issue isn't addressed or is only partially addressed, then proceed to Step 2.

## Step 2: Submit a request in GitHub

If the current documentation in [Partner Center for Windows Hardware documentation](index.yml)) doesn't cover your issue, you can submit a support request through GitHub.  When you submit a request in GitHub, you'll be directly contacting the Partner Center drivers team.

To submit a request to the Partner Center drivers team in GitHub:

1. Go to the Partner Center documentation web page that you believe should've been able to help you with your issue. For the sake of example, you might find that your issue isn't addressed on the [Create a new hardware submission page](hardware-submission-create.md).

>[!TIP]
>If the content you are looking for doesn't exist at all, just find a page that is relatively related to your issue.

1. Once you're on the page, select the feedback icon on the upper right side of the page.

1. Enter the title and content of your feedback.

1. Select **Submit new issue**.

1. You should receive a response from the team within 24-48 business hours.

## Step 3: Submit request to Windows developer support

If you've been unable to resolve your issue through GitHub or your issue has been escalated to a support issue, you'll need to contact Windows developer support.
