# Windows Certified Products List

The [Windows Certified Products List](https://aka.ms/AA5bmch) is a comprehensive list of certified devices and systems.

You can find devices and systems by filtering the list or by running a search for a specific product name.

You can search across all certified devices and systems for the entire catalog.

Additionally, customers who need an OEM system report for RFPs can search for the product/marketing name and receive a verification report, which you can download. 

Declarative & Universal status is displayed for all Device Classes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>System search does not support the D&U status field. Therefore, you must set the **D & U Status** search field dropdown to All to see system results.

## To search for Marketing/Product names for systems or devices


Searches that you perform in the ** Marketing/Product Name** box will find matches in the product name, submission name, and marketing name fields.

You should limit your search to plain text, without quotes or wildcards.

Any spaces between words will be treated as an AND expression.

You may not use any special characters or search-limiting terms. For example, do not use (OR, AND, ””, *, ?, etc.).


## To search for Company Name 

Searches should be limited to plain text, without quotes or wildcards. For example, do not use (OR, AND, ””, *, ?, etc.).

The search function will auto-complete results after 5 letters are typed. 

> [!Note]
>You may find that some companies are listed twice. This is a result of merging the previous database with Hardware Dev Center. Each entry is different, so it’s best to search using the Marketing/Product Name field.
