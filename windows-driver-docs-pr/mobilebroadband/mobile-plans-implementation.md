# Mobile Plans implementation

[!include[Mobile Plans Beta Prerelease](../mobile-plans-beta-prerelease.md)]

This topic describes MO Direct portal design policies and guidance to work with Mobile Plans, as well as the work needed to implement the Web service API that will host your experiences in the Mobile Plans app.

## MO web portal

The MO Direct web portal allows mobile operators to provide connectivity solutions directly to Windows users through a curated web experience hosted in the Mobile Plans app. You need to create your web experiences following design policies and implement the web service API to make it reachable. 

For more info about Web portal flow and reference design, see [Web portal flow and reference design](mobile-plans-appendix.md#web-portal-flow-and-reference-design).

### Web Service API hosting MO Direct web portal 

The Mobile Plans app will use the [WebView](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.WebView) control to host the MO Direct experience. The app only trusts content returned by the Mobile Plans service.

When starting the WebView, the *EID*, *market*, and previous *ICCID* are passed if available. The following example shows these three launch parameters for eSIM.

```c#
MyWebView.ScriptNotify += MyWebView_ScriptNotify;

List<Uri> allowedUris = new List<Uri>();

allowedUris.AddRange(AllowedNotifyUris);

MyWebView.AllowedScriptNotifyUris = allowedUris;

MyWebView.Navigate(“https://moportal.com?eid=\”eid\”& iccid=8988247000100003319&market=us&transactionId=cvcvcv&location=us”);
```

The next example shows the launch parameters for a physical SIM: *iccid*, *market*, and *location*. Previous lines of code have been excised for brevity.

```c#
...

MyWebView.Navigate(“https://moportal.com? iccid=8988247000100003319&market=us&transactionId=waoigFfX00yGH3Vb.1&location=us”);
```

The Web Service API must disregard any additional parameters it might receive from Mobile Plans app. This provides flexibility for introducing new features without breaking the Mobile Plans experience. If new parameters are implemented, partners will be informed of new parameters in advance.

The following table describes the launch parameters available for eSIM and physical SIMs.

| Parameter name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| eid | The eSIM Identifier. This is sent only if an eSIM is present. | `eid= 89033024010400000100000000009136` |
| iccid | Required parameter for a physical SIM. Optional parameter for eSIM. Specifies the available ICCID’s on the physical sim. | `iccid=8988247000100003319` |
| iccids | Optional parameter. Specifies the list of ICCID’s from the available profile on an eSIM only. If there are no ICCID’s matching the MO available on the eSIM, this parameter won’t be sent. | `iccids=8988247000100003319, 988247000100003555` |
| location | The user’s current physical location with a country-level granularity. | `location=us` | 
| transactionId | The Transaction ID used for debugging the session. Providers should log this and send it in the notification payload. Maximum size is 64 characters.	| `transactionId=waoigFfX00yGH3Vb.1` |
| market | The 2-letter ISO code of the region settings in the PC. | `market=us` |

The user’s language preference will be sent using the Accept-Language header, described in the following table.

| Header name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accept-Language | The user’s current language settings. The MO portal should render the contents in the specified language if possible. | `Accept-Language: en-us` |

### MO Direct flow diagram

The following high-level flow diagram for eSIM MO Direct illustrates a scenario where the user doesn’t have an MO profile installed and is purchasing a plan from the MO portal.

The following diagram shows the high-level flow for MO Direct when the user has a eSIM profile or is using a physical SIM in their device.

<img src="images/dynamo_implementation_mo_direct_flow_with_sim.png" alt="MO Direct flow where user has an eSIM or physical SIM" title="MO Direct flow where user has an eSIM or physical SIM" width="400" />

### Control handoff to the Mobile Plans app

After the user completes the purchase flow, either by making a successful purchase or cancelling the purchase, the MO portal must return control to the Mobile Plans app. This is done by issuing a notification to the app with the result of the user interaction with the MO portal. The notification can be sent using JavaScript with the following syntax:

```javascript
DataMart.notifyPurchaseResult(notificationPayload);
```

An example of the notification payload for an eSIM is as follows:

```json
{
"ver":"1",
"purchaseResult":
“{
\"userAccount\":\"New\",
\"purchaseInstrument\":\"New\",
\"line\":\"New\",
\"moDirectStatus\":\"Complete\",
\"planName\":\"MyPlan\"
}”,
"success":true,
"Iccid":"8988247000100297655",
"activationCode":"activationCode",
"transactionId":"CDE2882E-BD5E-485F-B921-D0D60BBCF7FF"
}
```

An example of the notification payload for a physical SIM is as follows:

```json
{
"ver":"1",
"purchaseResult":
{
\"userAccount\":\"New\",
\"purchaseInstrument\":\"New\",
\"line\":\"New\",
\"moDirectStatus\":\"Complete\",
\"planName\":\"MyPlan\"
},
"success":true,
"iccid":”8988247000100297655”,
"transactionId":"CDE2882E-BD5E-485F-B921-D0D60BBCF7FF"
}
```

The MO Portal URI from which the notification is sent must be in the secure https protocol. The following table describes each field in the JSON payload of the notification:

| JSON field | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| success | Boolean | True if the user purchased an MO Direct plan. | `“success”:true` |
