# Mobile Plans promotional content

[!include[Mobile Plans Beta Prerelease](../mobile-plans-beta-prerelease.md)]

## Overview

This topic provides instructions for mobile operators to create and submit promotional campaign content in the Mobile Plans app.

## Promotional notifications

Windows includes support for interactive toast notifications that include text, images and button inputs. The Mobile Plans app enables mobile operators to show promotional content in toast notifications that can be triggered by the app.

## Promotional gateways

The Mobile Plans app includes a landing page for every mobile operator. The landing page can be customized with promotional content to highlight a brand or campaign message.

### Promotional gateway content

Promotional gateway content is defined using a JSON file with the following elements:

```JSON
{ // Root object
  "promotionTemplates": [
    { // PromotionTemplate
      "id": 123,
      "backgroundColor": "0x000000FF", // Black
      "bodyFontColor": "0xFFFFFFFF", // White
      "buttonColor": "0x414243FF", // Grey
      "buttonFontColor": "0xFFFFFFFF", // White
      "bodyText": "We’ll help you find a plan so you can get connected when W-Fi isn’t available",
      "buttonText": "Get started",
      "images": [
        { // Image
          "height": 480,
          "uri": "https://storagetos.datamart.windows.com/MO1/v1/en-US/landing740x480.png",
          "width": 740,
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The following table describes each JSON object in the previous example.
