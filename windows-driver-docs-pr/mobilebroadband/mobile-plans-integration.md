# Mobile Plans integration

[!include[Mobile Plans Beta Prerelease](../mobile-plans-beta-prerelease.md)]

This topic details the work that is needed to integrate the mobile operator backend and Microsoft systems together to enable Mobile Plans. Once this is complete, the integration will be at the ready-for-production checkpoint.

## Mobile operator integration into Microsoft environment

Microsoft will drive integration but it is expected that mobile operators will support Microsoft during this process, including access to eSIM profiles, mobile operator accounts to sign in to the web experience, and engineering resources to drive bug fixing.
