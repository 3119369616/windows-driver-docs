# Mobile Plans gateway page

## Overview

The Mobile Plans app hosts a Gateway page for every mobile operator enabled in the catalog. The Gateway page is shown to the end user as part of the Welcome step. It contains basic brand elements for the mobile operator, as well as several links and a privacy disclaimer. The Gateway page also includes a button to invoke the mobile operator web portal.

## Standard Gateway page

The standard Gateway page is shown to the end when there is no enhanced Gateway page defined. The standard Gateway page can also be shown as a downgraded experiend when there is a problem loading content for a mobile operator's enhanced Gateway page.

The standard Gateway page uses a basic template which cannot be customized by the mobile operator.
