* [**DMA_COMMON_BUFFER_EXTENDED_CONFIGURATION_TYPE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ne-wdm-_dma_common_buffer_extended_configuration_type) enumeration
* [**DMA_COMMON_BUFFER_EXTENDED_CONFIGURATION_ACCESS_TYPE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ne-wdm-dma_common_buffer_extended_configuration_access_type) enumeration
* [**DMA_COMMON_BUFFER_EXTENDED_CONFIGURATION**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-dma_common_buffer_extended_configuration) structure

Updated:

* [**DMA_OPERATIONS**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_dma_operations) structure (new field **CreateCommonBufferFromMdl**)

## NetAdapterCx

* The new [NetAdapterCx platform-level device reset (PLDR)](./netcx/platform-level-device-reset.md) feature provides an effective way to reset and recover malfunctioning network devices without rebooting the system.

* NetAdapterCx support for the following hardware offloads has been updated:

    * [Checksum offload](./netcx/checksum-offload.md)

    *  [Generic send offload (GSO)](./netcx/gso-offload.md)

    * [Receive Segment Coalescing (RSC)](./netcx/rsc-offload.md)

## Networking

New network driver documentation and features include:

* The new [NDIS packet timestamping](./network/overview-of-ndis-packet-timestamping.md) feature supports the hardware timestamping capability of a network interface card (NIC) for the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) version 2.

* The new [NDIS Poll Mode](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/poll) feature is an OS controlled polling execution model that drives the network interface datapath.

* The [Virtual Machine Multiple Queues (VMMQ)](./network/overview-of-virtual-machine-multiple-queues.md) NIC offload technology extends Native RSS (RSSv1) to a Hyper-V virtual environment.

## Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF)

In WindowsÂ Server 2022, the Windows Driver Framework (WDF) includes Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) version 1.33 and User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) version 2.33.
