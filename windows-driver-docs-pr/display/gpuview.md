# GPUView

GPUView is a tool that reads logged video and kernel events from an event trace log (.etl) file and presents the data graphically to a user. Video core developers can use GPUView to determine the performance of the graphics processing unit (GPU) and the central processing unit (CPU) with regard to direct memory access (DMA) buffer processing (and all other video processing) on the video hardware. Developers and testers can use GPUView to show different kinds of events that might lead to unusual conditions like glitches, preparation delays, and poor synchronization.
