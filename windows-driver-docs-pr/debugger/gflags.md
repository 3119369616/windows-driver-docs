# GFlags

**GFlags**, the Global Flags Editor, enables and disables advanced debugging, diagnostic, and troubleshooting features. It's most often used to turn on indicators that other tools track, count, and log.

## Where to get GFlags

**GFlags.exe** is included in the [Debugging Tools for Windows 10 (WinDbg)](debugger-download-tools.md).

After the debugging tools are installed, the 64-bit version of **gflags.exe** is installed by default in the following directory.

```console
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64
```

If you're running a 32-bit version of Windows, use the 32-bit version of **gflags.exe** located here:

```console
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x86
```

## Overview of GFlags

Driver developers and testers often use **GFlags** to turn on debugging, logging, and test features either directly, or by including GFlags commands in a test script. The page heap verification features can help you to identify memory leaks and buffer errors in **kernel-mode** drivers.

**GFlags** has both a dialog box and a command-line interface. Most features are available from both interfaces, but some features are accessible from only one of the interfaces. For more information, see [GFlags details](gflags-details.md).

### Features

- Page heap verification. GFlags includes the functions of `PageHeap` (pageheap.exe), a tool that enables heap allocation monitoring. 

- No reboot is required for the *Special Pool* feature. You can enable, disable, and configure the Special Pool feature without restarting ("rebooting") the computer. For more information, see [Special Pool](special-pool.md).

- Object Reference Tracing. A flag enables tracing of object referencing and object dereferencing in the kernel. This feature detects when an object reference count is decremented too many times or not decremented even though an object is no longer used. 

- The GFlags dialog box has tabbed pages for easy navigation.

### Requirements

To use most GFlags features, including setting flags in the registry or in kernel mode, or enabling page heap verification, you must be a member of the Administrator's group on the computer.
