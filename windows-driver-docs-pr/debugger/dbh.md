# DBH

The DBH tool (dbh.exe) is a command-line tool that displays information about the contents of a symbol file.

DBH exposes the functionality of the DbgHelp API (dbghelp.dll) through a convenient command-line interface. Therefore, its behavior may change as DbgHelp is updated. For more information, see [Debug Help Library](/windows/win32/debug/debug-help-library).
