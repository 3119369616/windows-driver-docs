# Set up your development environment

This article shows you how to set up your development environment using the Sharks Cove board and Microsoft-provided software development tools to build a universal sensor driver for your sensor.

Sharks Cove is a development board designed and configured to be the core of an x86-based tablet platform. Other devices such as cameras, sensors, and a display, are left out of the design of the board, so that new versions of these devices can be developed and tested using Sharks Cove.

You can order a Sharks Cove from [RCS Components](https://www.rcscomponents.kiev.ua/sharkscove%20by%20circuitco).

Before you get started with this exercise, make sure that you have the following hardware:

- A Sharks Cove board with included power cord and adapter
- A test board with your sensor mounted on it
- A powered USB hub
- A USB keyboard
- A USB mouse
- A USB network adapter
- A monitor and HDMI cable (possibly with HDMI cable adapters)

For detailed instructions about how to connect and set up the hardware in the preceding list, see [Sharks Cove hardware development board](../gettingstarted/sharks-cove-hardware-development-board.md). Perform all the tasks up to, and including, Step 4.

If you successfully completed the steps suggested in the preceding paragraph, then your development environment should now have:

- Microsoft kits and tools downloaded and installed
- Sharks Cove with the correct version of Windows installed
- Sharks Cove configured to receive and test a deployed driver

Follow the guidance in the next article to [prepare your sensor test board](prepare-your-sensor-test-board.md) to be connected to the Sharks Cove board.
