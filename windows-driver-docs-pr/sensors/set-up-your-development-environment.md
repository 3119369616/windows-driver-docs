# Set up your development environment

This article shows you how to set up your development environment using a development board and Microsoft-provided software development tools to build a universal sensor driver for your sensor.

The Sharks Cove was a development board designed and configured to be the core of an x86-based tablet platform. Other devices such as cameras, sensors, and a display, are left out of the design of the board, so that new versions of these devices can be developed and tested using a development board.

> [!WARNING]
> The Sharks Cove hardware development board is no longer supported. For a list of currently supported boards, see [SoCs and custom boards](/windows/iot-core/learn-about-hardware/socsandcustomboards).

Before you get started with this exercise, make sure that you have the following hardware:

- A development board with included power cord and adapter
- A test board with your sensor mounted on it
- A powered USB hub
- A USB keyboard
- A USB mouse
- A USB network adapter
- A monitor and HDMI cable (possibly with HDMI cable adapters)

For example instructions about how to connect and set up one development boards, see [Sharks Cove hardware development board](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/devtest/devboards/sharks-cove-hardware-development-board). Perform all the tasks up to, and including, Step 4.

If you successfully completed the steps suggested in the preceding paragraph, then your development environment should now have:

- Microsoft kits and tools downloaded and installed
- Development board with the correct version of Windows installed
- Development board configured to receive and test a deployed driver

Follow the guidance in the next article to [prepare your sensor test board](prepare-your-sensor-test-board.md) to be connected to the development board.
