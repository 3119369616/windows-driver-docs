# INF DDInstall.Services section

Each per-Models *DDInstall*.**Services** section contains one or more **[INF AddService directives](inf-addservice-directive.md)** that reference additional INF-writer-defined sections in an INF file.

```inf
[install-section-name.Services] |
[install-section-name.nt.Services] |
[install-section-name.ntx86.Services] |
[install-section-name.ntia64.Services] | (Windows XP and later versions of Windows)
[install-section-name.ntamd64.Services] | (Windows XP and later versions of Windows)
[install-section-name.ntarm.Services] | (Windows 8 and later versions of Windows)
[install-section-name.ntarm64.Services] (Windows 10 version 1709 and later versions of Windows)
 
AddService=ServiceName,[flags],service-install-section
                     [,event-log-install-section[,[EventLogType][,EventName]]]...]
[DelService=ServiceName[,[flags][,[EventLogType][,EventName]]]]...
[Include=filename.inf[,filename2.inf]...]
[Needs=inf-section-name[,inf-section-name]...] 
```

You can provide a *DDInstall*.**Services** section with at least one **AddService** directive to control how and when the services of a particular driver are loaded, dependencies on other services or drivers, and so forth. Optionally, you can also specify event-logging services.

## Entries

**AddService**=*ServiceName*, [*flags*],*service-install-section*[,*event-log-install-section*[,[*EventLogType*][,*EventName*]]]...]  
This directive references an INF-writer-defined *service-install-section* and, possibly, an *event-log-install-section* elsewhere in the INF file for the drivers of the devices covered by this *DDInstall* section. For more information, see **[INF AddService Directive](inf-addservice-directive.md)**.

**DelService**=*ServiceName* [,[*flags*][,[*EventLogType*][,*EventName*]]]...  
This directive removes a previously installed service from the target computer. This directive is very rarely used. For more information, see **[INF DelService Directive](inf-delservice-directive.md)**.

**Include**=*filename.inf* [,*filename2.inf*]...  
This optional entry specifies one or more additional system-supplied INF files that contain sections needed to install this device. If this entry is specified, usually so is a **Needs** entry.

**Needs**=*inf-section-name* [,*inf-section-name*]...  
This optional entry specifies the section that must be processed during the installation of this device. Typically, the section is a *DDInstall*.**Services** section within a system-supplied INF file that is listed in an **Include** entry. However, it can be any section that is referenced within a *DDInstall*.**Services** section.

## Remarks

*DDInstall*.**Services** sections should have the same platform and operating system decorations as their related *[DDInstall](inf-ddinstall-section.md)* sections. For example, an *install-section-name*.**ntx86** section would have a corresponding *install-section-name*.**ntx86.Services** section.

The specified *DDInstall* section must be referenced in a device/models-specific entry under the per-manufacturer *Models* section of the INF file. The case-insensitive extensions to the *install-section-name* shown in the formal syntax statement can be inserted into such a *DDInstall*.**Services** section name in cross-platform INF files.

For more information about how to use the system-defined **.nt**, **.ntx86**, **.ntia64**, **.ntamd64**, **.ntarm**, and **.ntarm64** extensions, see [Creating INF Files for Multiple Platforms and Operating Systems](creating-inf-files-for-multiple-platforms-and-operating-systems.md).

## Examples

This example shows the *install-section-name*.**NT.Services** section and its service-install-sections in the INF file for an example driver package that adds a function driver and filter driver to a device.

```inf
[Example_DDInstall.Services]
AddService=ExampleFunctionDriver,0x00000002,function_ServiceInstallSection
AddService=ExampleUpperFilter,,filter_ServiceInstallSection

[function_ServiceInstallSection]
DisplayName    = %function_ServiceDesc%
ServiceType    = 1
StartType      = 3
ErrorControl   = 1
ServiceBinary  = %13%\ExampleFunctionDriver.sys

[filter_ServiceInstallSection]
DisplayName    = %filter_ServiceDesc%
ServiceType    = 1
StartType      = 3
ErrorControl   = 1
ServiceBinary  = %13%\ExampleUpperFilter.sys

[Strings] ; only immediately preceding %strkey% tokens shown here
%function_ServiceDesc%="Example function driver service"
%filter_ServiceDesc%="Example filter driver service"
```

See **[INF DDInstall.HW Section](inf-ddinstall-hw-section.md)** for more examples of *DDInstall*.**Services** sections with some *service-install-section*s referenced by the **[AddService](inf-addservice-directive.md)** directive. This includes one for a PnP filter driver.
