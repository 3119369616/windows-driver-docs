# NDIS\_STATUS\_WDI\_INDICATION\_DISASSOCIATION (dot11wificxintf.h)

[!INCLUDE [WiFiCx topic note](../includes/wificx-version-warning.md)]


WiFiCx drivers use NDIS\_STATUS\_WDI\_INDICATION\_DISASSOCIATION to indicate that a port disconnected from the network.

| Object |
|--------|
| Port   |

 

The disconnect may be triggered by a command from the operating system or triggered from the network. Network triggered disconnect may be explicit from received disassociation or deauthentication packets, or may be implicit when the port cannot detect the presence of the peer it is connected to.

Before the disassociation indication is sent, the port must clear the state associated with this peer. This includes any keys and 802.1x port authorization information associated with this peer. The port must not trigger a roam on its own.

## MLO connection requirements
The driver will send the NDIS_STATUS_WDI_INDICATION_DISASSOCIATION indication only when all links have been disassociated. If the driver connects on a new link or is disconnected from a currently-connected link, the driver will just send a [NDIS_STATUS_WDI_INDICATION_LINK_STATE_CHANGE](ndis-status-wdi-indication-link-state-change.md) notification to update the set of links on which it is currently associated.

When sending the NDIS_STATUS_WDI_INDICATION_DISASSOCIATION indication, the driver should set the MAC address in [WDI_TLV_DISASSOCIATION_INDICATION_PARAMETERS](wdi-tlv-disassociation-indication-parameters.md) as the AP's MLD MAC address.

For more information, see [WiFiCx Wi-Fi 7 feature requirements](wificx-wi-fi-7.md).
